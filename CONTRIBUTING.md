## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or 3.12
- Git
- Familiarity with xLights and audio sequencing (helpful but not required)

### Setup Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/helix-sequencer.git
   cd helix-sequencer
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. **Run tests to verify setup:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q
   ```

## Making Changes

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Line length: 100 characters (prefer readability over strict limits)
- Type hints are encouraged (Python 3.11+)

### Commit Messages

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb: "Add", "Fix", "Refactor", "Update", etc.
- Reference issues when relevant: `Fix #123`
- Keep first line under 50 characters; add details in body if needed

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass locally:
  ```bash
  python -m pytest -q
  ```
- Tests should be in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names: `test_<function>_<scenario>`

### Documentation

- Update README.md if you change user-facing behavior
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Use Google-style docstrings:
  ```python
  def example(arg: str) -> int:
      """Short description.
      
      Longer description if needed.
      
      Args:
          arg: Description of arg.
      
      Returns:
          Description of return value.
      
      Raises:
          ValueError: When something is wrong.
      """
  ```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure tests pass:**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest -q
   ```

2. **Push to your fork:**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Open a Pull Request on GitHub:**
   - Use a clear title describing the change
   - Reference any related issues: "Closes #123"
   - Describe what changed and why

   - What actually happened
4. **Provide context:**
   - OS and Python version
   - xLights version
   - Relevant files or snippets
   - Contents of `run_manifest.json` from a failed run (helpful for diagnostics)
